It's play time, people! Many kids initial fascination with computers, like that of nerdy kids, 
had to do with computer games. They were drawn into the tiny simulated worlds that they could 
manipulate and in which stories (sort of) unfolded—more, I suppose, because of the way they 
projected their imagination into them than because of the possibilities they actually offered. 
I don’t wish a career in game programming on anyone. Much like the music industry, the discrepancy 
between the number of eager young people wanting to work in it and the actual demand for such people 
creates a rather unhealthy environment. But writing games for fun is amusing. In this milestone, 
you are going to create one of the following grid games. We will use the browser DOM to display the 
game, and we’ll read user input by handling key events.
- Image Puzzle game
- 2048 game 
- Tic-tac-toe game 
- Design your own browser game
